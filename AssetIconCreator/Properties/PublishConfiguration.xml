# Asset Icon Creator
Easily create icons for your assets with a click of a button!

From props, to buildings, and brands' billboards and signs. Create the perfect icons within seconds for your assets.




## How to use
While in the Editor, or in-game, place the asset you want to create an icon for, and click on the "Asset Icon Creator" button in the Asset Editor's toolbar, or use the Hot-Key.

Then click on the asset and Asset Icon Creator will take care of the rest. You'll then see a preview of the icon on the bottom left of your screen.




## Custom Styles
In Asset Icon Library's settings page, you can change the style of building icons from the selection of:
* Colored and no props
* White and no props
* Colored with props




## Custom Options
Be sure to check the mod's options for more customization and extra features.
